# mirage-time-defunctorised

This is an opam overlay repository for MirageOS where Time is no longer functorised.

The plan is to publish all the packages in here to the main opam-repository once we're satisfied and have reviewed the patches.

Using this repository can be done by: `opam repo add time-defunctorised git+https://github.com/hannesm/mirage-time-defunctorised.git`
