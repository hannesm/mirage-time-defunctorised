synopsis: "DHCP wire frame encoder and decoder"
description: """
Charrua consists a single modules, `Dhcp_wire` responsible for parsing and
constructing DHCP messages

You can browse the API for [charrua](http://www.github.com/mirage/charrua) at
https://mirage.github.io/charrua/

#### Features

* `Dhcp_wire` provides marshalling and unmarshalling utilities for DHCP.
* Logic/sequencing is agnostic of IO and platform, so it can run on Unix as a
  process, as a Mirage unikernel or anything else.
* All DHCP options are supported at the time of this writing.
* Code is purely applicative.
* It's in OCaml, so it's pretty cool.

The name `charrua` is a reference to the, now extinct, semi-nomadic people of
southern South America.
